"Renée Stotijn is born on February 7, 1940 in Hilversum, as the eldest "
"daughter in a family of\n"
"                        four children. Soon after her birth Renée’s "
"parents move to the south of Amsterdam, and come\n"
"                        to live behind the Concertgebouw (concert hall). "
"It is a practical choice for the family, as her\n"
"                        father, Haakon Stotijn, is appointed as a solo "
"oboist in the Concertgebouw orchestra.\n"
"                        Renée starts drawing at the age of five after "
"receiving a book from her father on early\n"
"                        renaissance Italian painting. She is fascinated "
"by this art and memorizes all the painters.\n"
"                        At this point already she has made up her mind; "
"she will become a painter.\n"
"                        Unfortunately, problems arise in the family and "
"her parents divorce in 1952 when she is 12\n"
"                        years old. Renée is determined to leave with her "
"father because of a difficult relationship\n"
"                        between her mother and herself. Her younger "
"sister Marion decides to go with Renee and her\n"
"                        father. They wander across the city for years in "
"search of accommodation. At this time Renée\n"
"                        and Marion stay with various caretakers at "
"different addresses. In 1957 Haakon and his two\n"
"                        daughters eventually settle on the Weesperzijde "
"in the east of Amsterdam."
